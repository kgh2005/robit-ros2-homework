[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_msgs_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_msgs_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_msgs_pkg"
  with any of the following names:

    custom_msgs_pkgConfig.cmake
    custom_msgs_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_msgs_pkg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "custom_msgs_pkg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "custom_msgs_pkg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
